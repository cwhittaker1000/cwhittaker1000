👋 Hi there! I'm Charlie Whittaker! I'm an infectious disease researcher and PhD student based in the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis). 

🔬 My research interests are primarily focussed on mathematical modelling and public health, where I've explored a range of questions focussed on the dynamics and spread of various infectious diseases including:
- 🦟**Malaria:** Improving our understanding of malaria seasonality and its drivers. 
- 🐛**Loiasis:** Modelling the impact of different pharmaceutical control strategies using Ivermectin or Albendazole.
- 💉**Ebola:** Working with the World Health Organization in DRC during the 2018-2020 North Kivu Ebola Outbreak.
- 🦠**COVID-19:** Characterising the impact and epidemiological properties of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.

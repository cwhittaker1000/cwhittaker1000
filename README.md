👋 Hi there! I'm Charlie Whittaker! I'm the Sir Henry Wellcome Research Fellow in **Infectious Disease Epidemiology** and **Mathematical Modelling** at the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis). 

🔬 My research centres around mathematical modelling of infectious disease transmission, with a focus on the detectability, dynamics and control of pathogens with pandemic potential. Some of the current questions I'm working on include:  
- 🦠Characterising the impact and epidemiological properties of emerging **SARS-CoV-2** variants of concern.
- 🔜Developing tools for **pathogen-agnostic metagenomic screening** of wastewater with the folks a the [Nucleic Acid Observatory](https://www.naobservatory.org/). 
- 🦟Improving our understanding of **malaria** seasonality, with a particular focus on the invasive species *Anopheles stephensi*. 
- 🐛Modelling the impact of different interventions strategies on the burden of **loiasis** in Central Africa.
- 💉Characterising transmission dynamics and optimising vaccine deployment for **Ebola** control, in work carried out with the WHO during the 2018-2020 North Kivu Ebola Outbreak.

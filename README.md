👋 Hi there! I'm Charlie Whittaker! 

🎓 I'm an infectious disease researcher and PhD student based in the [MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis). You can find out more about me [here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/charles.whittaker16).

🔬 My research interests are primarily focussed on mathematical modelling, disease ecology and public health. To date, I've explored a range of scientific questions focussed on the dynamics and spread of various infectious diseases. These have included:
- 🦟**Malaria:** Trying to better understand the seasonality and temporal dynamics of the disease and the _Anopheline_ mosquitoes responsible for its transmission. 
- 🐛**Loiasis:** Modelling the impact of different pharmaceutical control strategies using Ivermectin or Albendazole.
- 💉**Ebola:** Primarily in the context of the 2018-2020 North Kivu Outbreak, where I spent time with the World Health Organization in DRC responding to the outbreak.
- 🦠**COVID-19:** Where my work is largely focussed on characterising the impact and epidemiological properties of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.
